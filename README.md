# Luca|EzioTheDeadPoet

## About Me

Hey my name is Luca, you most likely will know me as the creator of [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/) or one of my other mods or [Synthesis Patchers](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki#what-does-synthesis-do) found on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/42051055?tab=user+files).

I also help out with the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) Project by contributing to the app directly, writing documentation and updating the website. In my free time I enjoy videogames and try to get better at doing digital art and coding.

### My Wabbajack Modlists

- [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/) **Currently not available due to time and motivation issues.**  
  Primarily focused on bringing you a visual overhaul similar to Borderlands and other cell-shaded games and secondly focused on a player empowering progression and the addition of a huge amount of enchantments spread through the world of Skyrim.

- [Dishonored Plus](https://dishonored-plus.eziothedeadpoet.at/)  
  A small collection of essential mods for Dishonored that adds some QoL improvemnts.

### Discontinued Wabbajack Modlists

- [SME(FT) - Skyrim Modding Essentials (Fixes & Tools)](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/) **Discontinued since 19.07.2022**  
*Use [Skyrim Modding Essentials by Phoenix](https://thephoenixflavour.com/sme/) instead.*
